# Simple-Browser Instructions
A simple browser you can make in python with any code editor.

Put this in the terminal of your python project:

1. pip install PyQt5
2. pip install PyQtWebEngine

After you have done that step then copy and paste the code into your code editor from main.py

If you need any help go to the wiki page but if that does not help then write it in the issues section.

Feel free to change anything with the code
